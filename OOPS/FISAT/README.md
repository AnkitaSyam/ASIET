   - Three labels displaying “Enter 1st Number”, “Enter 2nd Number”, and “Result”.
   - Two text fields for entering two numbers and a third text field for showing the result of the operation.
   - Four buttons labeled +, -, *, and /. On clicking the + button, add the two numbers in the first two text fields and show the result in the third text field.

On clicking the / button, perform division and show the result in the third text field.
